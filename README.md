## User Experience Design

### Project Brief
The project goal is to provide a tool for users that wish to be UK citizens, which involves taking a quiz about Life in the UK as part of their assessment to get citizenship.

The site user's goals are to provide a short quiz about Life in the UK, with different categories available for the user to test their knowledge and practice for the formal test.
Allowing the user to have feedback throughout the quiz about their answers and also in the end to let them know their score.
Also providing a quick and efficient way for the user to test their knowledge on the go or during a short break.git add
